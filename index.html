                                <p>Pig dice game is played with a single six-sided die and players are allowed to make any number of rolls in each turn.</p>
                                <p>After each roll the dice value is added to their score for that turn. </p>
                                <p>After each roll player can decide whether to stop rolling and claim the total turn score or continue rolling</p>.
                                <p>If they roll a 1 then they lose all points scored in a particular turn and turn is then passed to the opponent.</p> 
                                <p>This has no impact on their overall score. If players decide to stop rolling,</p> 
                                <p>they get the points scored so far which is added to their overall score.</p>
                                <p>The first player to score 100 points (or any other predetermined score at the beginning of the game) wins the game.</p>
